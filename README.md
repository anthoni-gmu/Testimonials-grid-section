## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap  and Sass
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I liked bootstrap as it is a very easy and fast way to make designs, in the future I would like to learn another css framework and implement it with sass 

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - The official bootstrap documentation helped me a lot as a guide
